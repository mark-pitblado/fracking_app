			"A welbore is used to drill vertically into the earth for a depth of approximately 3000 metres. After it has reached this depth, the drill bit is rotated and a hole is drilled horizontally for approximately 1.5 kilometres within the shale layer. Once the well is drilled, a perforation gun is lowered into the well and fired to create a series of holes in the shale layer.",

		name: "Hydraulic Fracturing Stage",
		description:
			"A mix of water, propellants and chemical additives is pumped at high pressure into the well created during the Drilling stage. The intense pressure causes the liquid to cause tiny cracks in the shale layer to from from the divots left by the perforation gun. These cracks allow natural gas to flow into the well and the gas rises to the surface as bubbles through the liquid. The gas is then collected and transported to a processing facility.",

		description:
			"Flowback from the well contains both the gas and the liquid used to fracture the shale layer. While the flowback contains less than 1% chemical additives according to fracfocus.ca, the flowback can also contain small amounts of radioactive material. This water can either be sent to water treatment plants, or in can be injected into deep underground wells. While the water that is used in the process is dwarfed by industries such as agriculture, the amount of water used in the entire process can be significant for a town's local water supply.",
