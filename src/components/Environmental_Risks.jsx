						<p className='mt-4 text-gray-500'>
							There are two principle ways that fracking can contaminate water.
							The first is via leakage within the well into the water table,
							which communities may then draw upon for drinking or bathing. The
							second is via disposal of the wastewater which is produced during
							the fracking process. In British Columbia, disposing of wastewater
							is prohibited on the surface, so it is instead injected into deep
							wells. While chemicals are required to be disclosed publicly,
							there are exemptions made for proprietary information and
							trade-secrets. This means that the communities which have
							hydraulic fracturing sites near them may not have full and
							complete knowledge of the risks that they are facing, a serious
							concern given the potentially harmful effects of the chemicals
							used. An analysis of harmful effects that can result from the
							chemicals used in the fracking process can be found{" "}

								The 2019 report by the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon

							Methane Emissions

						<p className='mt-4 text-gray-500'>
							Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and is released into the

								Methane emissions into the air were not found to consitute a
								large portion of the total methane contamination from fracking

								that can be released from a single well, and this is expected to
								reduce the total amount of methane released by half.
